		</br>
		</br>
		<p class="header3p">Energy exists in many different forms. Examples of these are: light energy, heat energy, mechanical energy, gravitational energy, electrical energy, sound energy, chemical energy, nuclear or atomic energy and so on. Each form can be converted or changed into the other forms. Although there are many specific types of energy, the two major forms are Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy. Kinetic energy is the energy in moving objects or mass. Examples include mechanical energy, electrical energy etc. Potential energy is any form of energy that has stored potential that can be put to future use. Examples include nuclear energy, chemical energy, etc.</p>

		<p class="header3p">Chemical energy is energy stored in the bonds of chemical compounds (atoms and molecules).Chemical energy is released in a chemical reaction, often in the form of heat. For example, we use the chemical energy in fuels like wood, coal by burning them. Electrical energy is the energy carried by moving electrons in an electric conductor. It is one of the most common and useful forms of energy. Example  - Lightening. Other forms of energy are also converted to electrical energy. For example, power plants convert chemical energy stored in fuels like coal into electricity through various changes in its form. Mechanical energy is the energy a substance or system has because of its motion. For example machines use mechanical energy to do work. Thermal energy is the energy a substance or system has related to its temperature, i.e., the energy of moving or vibrating molecules. For example, we use the solar radiation to cook food. Nuclear energy is the energy that is trapped inside each atom. Nuclear energy can be produced either by the fusion (combining atoms) or fission (splitting of atoms) process. The fission process is the widely used method.</h1>
