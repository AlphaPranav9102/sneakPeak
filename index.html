		<h1 class="header1head">Why Sneak-Peak</h1>
		</br>	
		<p class="header3p">Sneak-Peak is the better way to learn by combining traditional teaching and modern, proven methods to teach students what they need in courses a few weeks ahead of their class to make sure they are both ahead and mastering the concepts when they get to class. By doing this we can effectively teach students the right way and give them the right tools to succeed. Sneak-Peak creates the materials of the standard Common-Core 2.0 and creates the same resources used in class but formulated better to make sure the student comprehends the material. Not only are the materials used original but some information is from the classrooms where the students are going to learn to make sure they know how to interpret the information in class. Our methods are cutting edge and are used by the top schools to ensure their students are the smart ones.

		<p class="header3p">"We tried everything  - Quizlet, Tutoring. When we found Sneak-Peak, we knew we found the right tool when our son immediately started getting 100% and straight A's. We would recommend this to anyone who children need help learning their material and understanding their material ahead of the time to do good in class."

		<p class="header3p">"Sneak-Peak was a simple tool to both integrate, duplicate, and use in our school systems. It was a gamechanger. Last year alone, our students saw a 3.5% average increase in scores. We are very grateful for the Sneak-Peak system and we recommend it to any teacher or learning group, big or small."

		<p class="header3p">"Not only did Sneak-Peak help me become a better math student, it also helped me understand classroom concepts and think outside the bow for why things work. Without a doubt Sneak-Peak changed my education life. I would recommend this to anyone."
